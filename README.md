==========================

**Note: This was a school assignment.**

This was a programming assignment from DePaul University's Mobile App Dev class (CSC 371). The idea was to try to recreate the game logic of the UnblockMe games from scratch. Has 3 levels and a level reset button if you want to start over. Pardon the aweful sound effects.
